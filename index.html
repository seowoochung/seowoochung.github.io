    <section>
      <p>Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University, 
        specializing in international political economy and international institutions. 
        My research examines how governments and firms navigate institutional constraints in 
        global economic governance, particularly in trade, investment, and climate. 
        Some topics I explore are the relationship between WTO escalation and foreign lobbying, 
        oil and gas firms' utilization of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), 
        and authoritarian censorship of trade disputes.

          International organizations promote cooperation by diffusing information among states and the public. 
        But how does this information reach the public under authoritarian regimes? I examine how an authoritarian government 
        with a censorship apparatus can use government-controlled media to offset international organizations’ 
        information effects. The authoritarian government selectively censors IO news based on the likelihood of success 
        in invoking a defensive reaction, suppressing complaints made by neutral counterparts that may lead to concerns for 
        noncompliance while allowing limited attention toward provocative complaints by hostile states. I find support for 
        my arguments through analysis of an original dataset of Chinese newspaper articles by 116 newspapers on all WTO 
        disputes involving China. Survey experiment on Chinese citizens tests the microfoundations of the information 
        strategy, finding that exposure to information about China being sued in a WTO dispute significantly reduces 
        support for international law, especially for those disputes against the United States.

          While some scholars argue that bureaucratic IOs tend to outgrow their mandates, others claim that IOs 
          curtail their activities under pressure. We introduce a new measure of scope expansion in IOs to adjudicate 
          this debate. We argue that IOs broaden their remits during stable periods, incorporating salient issues to 
          maintain relevance and competitiveness. However, during crises, they retrench and refocus on core priorities. 
          To test this argument, we analyze novel text data from IMF working papers, tracking the breadth of topics 
          covered by Fund researchers over time. We then assess whether shifts in IMF funding align with these trends. 
          Our findings show that the IMF moder- ately expanded its purview in the 21st century, incorporating gender 
          issues and climate change into its work, but significantly narrowed its focus during the 2007–2009 global 
          financial crisis. These results carry important implications for claims of IO overreach and offer insights 
          regarding the legitimacy and adaptability of global governance.

              Five years after the paralysis of the WTO dispute resolution mechanism, how has the mode of trade politics transformed? Existing scholarship lacks a framework for understanding how firms navigate alternative channels of foreign trade influence. I theorize that firm behavior reflects both agent-level factors, such as nationality, state ownership, and industry characteristics, and structural conditions, such as the institutional environment, which jointly shape the choice between WTO escalation and direct foreign lobbying. Firms allocate scarce resources strategically, shifting toward alternative pathways when certain channels become less effective. To test this, I combine two designs on firm-level lobbying and trade exposure: a panel analysis estimating the effect of the WTO crisis, and a triple-differences (DDD) design that compares how firms of different nationalities respond to tariff exposure before and after their country’s WTO accession. This methodological strategy provides a novel way to capture substitution across influence strategies, with implications for literature on business and politics, trade politics, and the role of international organizations.
