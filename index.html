    <section>
      <p>Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Columbia University, 
        specializing in international political economy and international institutions. 
        My research examines how governments and firms navigate institutional constraints in 
        global economic governance, particularly in trade, investment, and climate. 
        Some topics I explore are the relationship between WTO escalation and foreign lobbying, 
        oil and gas firms' utilization of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), 
        and authoritarian censorship of trade disputes.

        International organizations promote cooperation by diffusing information among states and the public. 
        But how does this information reach the public under authoritarian regimes? 
        I examine how an authoritarian government with a censorship apparatus can use government-controlled media 
        to offset international organizationsâ€™ information effects. 
        The authoritarian government selectively censors IO news based on the likelihood of success in 
        invoking a defensive reaction, highlighting provocative complaints by hostile states while 
        reducing those by others that may lead to suspicions about government behavior. 
        I find support for my arguments through analysis of an original dataset of Chinese newspaper articles 
        by 117 newspapers on all WTO disputes involving China. 
        I further conduct a survey experiment on Chinese adults, finding that exposure to 
        information about China being sued in a WTO dispute significantly reduces support for 
        international institutions and free trade, especially for those disputes against the United States.
